# LPU Internet Login Autofill Extension
## Description

This Chrome extension simplifies login to your college's internet portal by automatically filling in your credentials. Save your username and password securely in the provided content.js file, and enjoy the convenience of seamless login whenever you access the portal.

## Features

Auto-fills Login Credentials: The extension automatically populates the username and password fields on your college's login page, saving you time and effort.
Secure Credential Storage: Your credentials are stored directly within the content.js file, ensuring they remain within your browser environment and are not transmitted to any external servers. (Note: While convenient, storing credentials in plain text is not the most secure approach. Consider using encryption or a password manager for enhanced security.)
